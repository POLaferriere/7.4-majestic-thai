#Majestic Thai

This is an application made primarily with Backbone.js.  The goal of the project was to make an ordering website where users could specify which items they would like to order.  The order then is gathered, sub-totaled, taxed and totaled within the users view.  Users have the opportunity to change their order at any time, adding or removing any amount of items.  Once users confirmt their order, the order is saved to a server where it could be retrieved by the company owner.

The project was a culmination of what we had learned up until week 7, bringing all of our knowledge of Backbone models, collections, views and routers together to make a fairly complex CRUD app.  The gave an appreciation of the interaction between views in a Backbone app.
